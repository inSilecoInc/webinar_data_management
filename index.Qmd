:::
 
::: {.callout-tip }
### CARE: Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics
:::


## More than papers  

- Researchers produce a **diversity of artefacts**  
- Among these, **data** are increasingly important  
- More than papers → [Crossref Event Data](https://www.crossref.org/services/event-data/)  
- Datasets are now published standalone  


## What is “data”?  

- Broad definition: recorded information supporting research findings  
- Data can be **qualitative** or **quantitative**  
- Useful lens: the **5 V’s of Big Data**  
  - **Volume**, **Variety**, Velocity, Veracity, and **Value**  


## Data explosion (Volume)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- New questions & horizons → more data  
- Powerful tools enabling unprecedented data collection  
- Ex: Large Hadron Collider → ~40 Zettabytes in 2017

## ArcticNet

### Guiding Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Open Yet Protected** | Data & metadata should be as **open as possible**, and as **closed as necessary** (e.g. embargoes, privacy, confidentiality)   |
| **Citable & Preserved** | ArcticNet data must be **citable**, **publishable**, and **preserved**, with interoperability and links across platforms  
| **Infrastructure & Support** | Encourage use of existing interoperable systems; support researchers via training, resources, and outreach

## ArcticNet

### Requirements for Research Projects

- **Mandatory DMP**: Projects must create and continually update a Data Management Plan covering lifecycle stages, responsibilities, metadata, ethics, etc.
- **Metadata & Standards**: Use accepted disciplinary metadata standards (e.g., ISO, FGDC, Dublin Core); submit rich metadata early; failure to do so may delay funding releasesArcticNet-Data-Management-Policy-ADMP_Approved-March-2025.pdf)  
- **Storage & Preservation**: Researchers choose certified repositories (e.g., Nordicana-D, Polar Data Catalogue, GBIF, OBIS) and plan for long-term archival using preservation-friendly formatsArcticNet-Data-Management-Policy-ADMP_Approved-March-2025.pdf)  
- **Access & Sharing**: Data must be published openly when appropriate; exceptions include sensitive or Indigenous data, which must be justified in the DMP
- **Sensitive & Indigenous Data**: Follow anonymization, privacy protections, and engage Indigenous communities fully—respect CARE, OCAP®, NISR protocols 
- **Monitoring & Reporting**: Annual progress reports must include metadata links and any data-related incidents; researchers must notify and report security breaches within 24 hours

## Data heterogeneity 

- Variety
- Various objects, various to store data, various technologies, etc.
- Data vary widely across and within disciplines.
- Lack of standardized formats hinders integration and reuse.
- Legacy practices (e.g., local storage) limit access and preservation.


## Open science movement 

- Open Science 
- Open Access
- Reproducible research
- change in Journal and Funding agencies policies


## Importance of Standards & Metadata

- Early metadata standards: Dublin Core.
- Rise of FAIR principles as best practices in RDM.
- Role of platforms like Zenodo and Dryad in supporting open data.


## Gaps in Adoption

- Data standards and practices unevenly adopted across scientific communities.
- Especially problematic in interdisciplinary research projects (IRPs).


## Opportunities Through Proactive RDM

- Upstream coordination improves collaboration, data reuse, and long-term visibility.
- Structured governance fosters unexpected synergies.


## ArcticNet

- Some short background history on ArcticNet and past initiatives in terms of data management
- Imporve RDM practice over time







<!-- ## Raw vs processed data  -->

<!-- > Some authors defend that data are realistically never raw, as they are always collected in a specific context that may be subject to bias and interpretation, which can have a significant impact on the results -->

<!-- Don't think the actual voltage returned by any instrument is meaningful, so needs to add context (techno, intrument, etc.) and thus somewhat data are always sometime meaningful only after some treatment, e.g. sonar detection, etc. -->
<!-- What data to be shared is discussed with the community -->

# Data Management Plan -- 30min

## Importance 

> A data management plan, or DMP, is a formal document that outlines how data will be handled during and after a research project. Many funding agencies, especially government sources, require a DMP as part of their application processes.

  - DMP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_JzQxxC4ts


## Data collection 

- Protocols 
- Types of data (e.g., observational, model outputs, images)
- Formats and estimated volume
- Structure and naming conventions

## Documentation and Metadata

- Standards used (e.g., ISO 19115, Darwin Core)
- Tools or platforms used for metadata creation (e.g., Polar Data Catalog)
- Timing of metadata creation (start early, update as needed)
- ArcticNet will provide a template for PDC metadata submission

## Storage, Backup, Preservation

- How data will be stored 
- How will you ensure that data will be preserved
- V value 


## Sharing and Reuse

- Who will access the data and when (open, embargoed, restricted)
- How data will be cited (DOIs or other persistent IDs)
- Licensing terms (e.g., CC-BY, custom agreements)

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

- Privacy concerns, ethics approvals
- Indigenous data sovereignty and OCAP/CARE principles
- Embargo periods, licensing, or access restrictions


## Responsibilities and Resources

- Who is responsible of what?


## Role of the network 

- Support researchers in writing their DMP 
- Ideally foresee potential synergies among researchers for data collection
- Training: RDM 101
- A DMP template for ArticNet?
- Propose a list of platforms?





# Data collection and analysis -- 20min


## Importance 

- Actual work
- During collection, focus on collection, note all details 
- During analysis phase, write down the metadata
- Write metadata for PDC?


## Metadata 

- metadata =  data that describe data 
- Contextualize data 
- A central element in sharing data internally and externally (data catalogue)


## One example: Dublin Core

- 2-3 slides about the grammar of the Dublin Core


## Role of the network

- define a metadata standard for the project
- supporting researchers in writing metadata
- ideally setting tools to manage metadata
