## Data heterogeneity (Variety)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
- Different objects, storage formats, technologies  
- Data vary widely across and within disciplines  
- Lack of standards hinders integration and reuse  
- Legacy practices (e.g., local storage) limit access and preservation  
- Prevalent in large Interdisciplinary Research Programs

## Benefits (Value)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
- We need reliable data to better understand and predict
  - anticipate/mitigate future changes
  - Ex: good assessment of temperature and precipitation change
- Some data are hard to collect
  - Arctic Data are good example
- Data are **precious** for future generations
  - We won't be able to collect past data

# Future 

Emerging Trends & Opportunities

10 min


# Q&A

10 min





## Importance of Standards & Metadata

- Early metadata standards: Dublin Core.
- Rise of FAIR principles as best practices in RDM.
- Role of platforms like Zenodo and Dryad in supporting open data.


## Gaps in Adoption

- Data standards and practices unevenly adopted across scientific communities.
- Especially problematic in interdisciplinary research projects (IRPs).


## Opportunities Through Proactive RDM

- Upstream coordination improves collaboration, data reuse, and long-term visibility.
- Structured governance fosters unexpected synergies.


## ArcticNet

- Some short background history on ArcticNet and past initiatives in terms of data management
- Imporve RDM practice over time







<!-- ## Raw vs processed data  -->

<!-- > Some authors defend that data are realistically never raw, as they are always collected in a specific context that may be subject to bias and interpretation, which can have a significant impact on the results -->

<!-- Don't think the actual voltage returned by any instrument is meaningful, so needs to add context (techno, intrument, etc.) and thus somewhat data are always sometime meaningful only after some treatment, e.g. sonar detection, etc. -->
<!-- What data to be shared is discussed with the community -->

# Data Management Plan -- 30min

## Importance 

> A data management plan, or DMP, is a formal document that outlines how data will be handled during and after a research project. Many funding agencies, especially government sources, require a DMP as part of their application processes.

  - RDM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm7qIkrL3wM
  - DMP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_JzQxxC4ts


## Data collection 

- Protocols 
- Types of data (e.g., observational, model outputs, images)
- Formats and estimated volume
- Structure and naming conventions

## Documentation and Metadata

- Standards used (e.g., ISO 19115, Darwin Core)
- Tools or platforms used for metadata creation (e.g., Polar Data Catalog)
- Timing of metadata creation (start early, update as needed)
- ArcticNet will provide a template for PDC metadata submission

## Storage, Backup, Preservation

- How data will be stored 
- How will you ensure that data will be preserved
- V value 


## Sharing and Reuse

- Who will access the data and when (open, embargoed, restricted)
- How data will be cited (DOIs or other persistent IDs)
- Licensing terms (e.g., CC-BY, custom agreements)

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

- Privacy concerns, ethics approvals
- Indigenous data sovereignty and OCAP/CARE principles
- Embargo periods, licensing, or access restrictions


## Responsibilities and Resources

- Who is responsible of what?


## Role of the network 

- Support researchers in writing their DMP 
- Ideally foresee potential synergies among researchers for data collection
- Training: RDM 101
- A DMP template for ArticNet?
- Propose a list of platforms?





# Data collection and analysis -- 20min


## Importance 

- Actual work
- During collection, focus on collection, note all details 
- During analysis phase, write down the metadata
- Write metadata for PDC?


## Metadata 

- metadata =  data that describe data 
- Contextualize data 
- A central element in sharing data internally and externally (data catalogue)


## One example: Dublin Core

- 2-3 slides about the grammar of the Dublin Core


## Role of the network

- define a metadata standard for the project
- supporting researchers in writing metadata
- ideally setting tools to manage metadata
