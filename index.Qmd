# Data 

## Raw vs processed data 

> Some authors defend that data are realistically never raw, as they are always collected in a specific context that may be subject to bias and interpretation, which can have a significant impact on the results

Don't think the actual voltage returned by any instrument is meaningful, so needs to add context (techno, intrument, etc.) and thus somewhat data are always sometime meaningful only after some treatment, e.g. sonar detection, etc.
What data to be shared is discussed with the community

# Data Management Plans 


# Data and metadata

- metadata are data that describes data

# IA 

medata have big role to evenetually feed IA using IA as sythesis tool

Not that I am blindly endorsing IA, however it's a Turing Machine that crunching and digesting data is every possible way, may provide insights
