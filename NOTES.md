> The movement towards publishing and citing datasets as standalone objects has been particularly prominent in recent years, and is but one component of an ongoing shift in scholarly publishing.


Do not need to make it hard to extract data
we could argue IA could do it, but cost energy

RMap employs a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) API





===> Hanson K. Using RMap to Describe Distributed Works as Linked Data Graphs.

> The goal of the RMap project was to build a prototype service that can capture and preserve the maps of relationships found amongst these distributed works

> In recent years, the content that comprises the scholarly record has shifted from being primarily discrete text-based bounded objects, such as journals or books, to more dynamic and less “bounded” content that might include data, webpages, software, and more. In other words, the boundaries of the scholarly record are stretching beyond the traditional publication of outcomes to instead encompass additional outputs created during the process and aftermath of the work [10]. This means a scholarly work can be complex, dynamic, and consist of multiple distributed parts. An example of a typical map of the heterogeneous resources that comprise and describe a single work is shown in Figure 1.

RMap aims to capture and preserve links amongst the artifacts of scholarly communication and those who create, modify, employ, and annotate them


The graph dataset was created using the Research Graph data model and the Research Data Switchboard (RD-Switchboard), a collaborative project by the Research Data Alliance DDRI Working Group (DDRI WG) with the aim to discover and connect the related research datasets based on publication co-authorship or jointly funded grants

- D-Switchboard also inactve since ... good data model though

> For instance, Vines et al. 2014 reported a half-life of four years for data recovery from the original authors.


> Among the reasons why researchers do not publish reproducibly, Borgman (2007) mentions (1) a lack of incentives in terms of citations or promotion, (2) the effort required to clean data and codes, (3) the creation of a competitive advantage over other fellows, and (4) intellectual property issues

> An ERC facilitates a scientific publication that is not only composed of a paper but also the data, the source code, and the software environment, packaged in an executable manner.

> However, good RDM requires considerable resources such as time and effort when data documentation is not supported by automated processes. In addition, there exist cultural barriers for data sharing at an early stage of research, especially for data that are not (yet) intended for public access.

> Therefore, funding institutions like the German Research Foundation (DFG) increased their emphasis on implementing RDM practices in research projects, demonstrated, e.g., by a revision of its guidelines for safeguarding Good Scientific Practice (DFG, 2022).


> For large interdisciplinary research projects, the agreement and implementation of common standards for metadata is a critical step for efficient RDM.

> As the CRC use case shows, agreeing on a common metadata schema for collaborative research takes time, especially when a data model and RDM tools are developed in parallel. It took the CRC researchers around two years to agree on just 14 metadata fields, including controlled vocabularies and mappings. An early start to such a process is therefore highly recommended.

> Favoring fewer but essential fields in the metadata schema facilitates swift cross-collaboration communication and aligns with researchers’ daily RDM workflows.

Metadata

> To extract the maximum information, raw data must be combined with appropriate metadata. Metadata encompasses all the additional information that provides context and describes the characteristics, properties, and attributes of raw data. Metadata provide essential context, descriptions, and interpretations that are necessary for understanding and correctly using the raw data within a given context or domain

NDRIO, rebranded later that year as the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (the Alliance), is a non-profit  organization that has been designated by the Canadian government to channel funding to higher education  institutions across the three pillars of digital research infrastructure (DRI), including RDM, research  software, and ARC (Winter 2021).

> In March 2021, the three main public funding agencies in Canada (the Tri-Agencies) released a harmonized  RDM Policy (Government of Canada 2021).


https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/research-data-management/tri-agency-research-data-management-policy

    - Research data management (RDM) is a necessary part of research excellence.
    - To this end, the agencies support the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) guiding principles for research data management and stewardship.

Note: The Tri-agency in Canada refers to the three federal funding agencies that support research: Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).
