> The movement towards publishing and citing datasets as standalone objects has been particularly prominent in recent years, and is but one component of an ongoing shift in scholarly publishing.


Do not need to make it hard to extract data
we could argue IA could do it, but cost energy


Open Archives Initiative  Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE)

RMap employs a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) API





===> Hanson K. Using RMap to Describe Distributed Works as Linked Data Graphs.

> The goal of the RMap project was to build a prototype service that can capture and preserve the maps of relationships found amongst these distributed works

> In recent years, the content that comprises the scholarly record has shifted from being primarily discrete text-based bounded objects, such as journals or books, to more dynamic and less “bounded” content that might include data, webpages, software, and more. In other words, the boundaries of the scholarly record are stretching beyond the traditional publication of outcomes to instead encompass additional outputs created during the process and aftermath of the work [10]. This means a scholarly work can be complex, dynamic, and consist of multiple distributed parts. An example of a typical map of the heterogeneous resources that comprise and describe a single work is shown in Figure 1.

RMap aims to capture and preserve links amongst the artifacts of scholarly communication and those who create, modify, employ, and annotate them


The graph dataset was created using the Research Graph data model and the Research Data Switchboard (RD-Switchboard), a collaborative project by the Research Data Alliance DDRI Working Group (DDRI WG) with the aim to discover and connect the related research datasets based on publication co-authorship or jointly funded grants

- D-Switchboard also inactve since ... good data model though

> For instance, Vines et al. 2014 reported a half-life of four years for data recovery from the original authors.


> Among the reasons why researchers do not publish reproducibly, Borgman (2007) mentions (1) a lack of incentives in terms of citations or promotion, (2) the effort required to clean data and codes, (3) the creation of a competitive advantage over other fellows, and (4) intellectual property issues
